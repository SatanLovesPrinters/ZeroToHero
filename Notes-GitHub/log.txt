- Notes: 
- Struggled with first repository. Restarting & attempting later on. 

08/16/2023 - 4:05pm 
- New repo is working
- Identified System Env Variables as possible road block
- Issue #1 created in GitHub.
-- Idea is to review the full need of %AppData% usage vs having a root folder C:\rootGit

Syncing Step-by-Step:

If someone adds to the WebClient
- Discard your current changes or merge changes
- git pull
If git pull does not work due to other files being staged:
- Clear your staged files with:
- Git restore . 
Git diff should then show no changes in place
- git status
- git checkout -- .
To confirm header once more
- git status
- git pull 

--- If a change occurs --- Think about the three stages.

08/16/2023 - Key ideas to work on:
- origin vs main 
-- Is origin always the web client vs main always being local? 
-- Git Graph allows you to copy commit hashes & merge specific editions w/ select branches.
----Git Graph ("Look at this file" > at this "commit" under this "time frame")
----You can mark commits as reviewed > enabling more project orchestration. 
-- Git Graph & Git History correlate
--- Git History allows you to View / Compare / Drill down into other commits/version history. 
----Gives soft & hard reset - Tag features & Commit manipulation.

GitLens = Most Common/Advanced Integration Extension App
Apart of GitKraken - All public repo's are free with GitLens / Private is subscription based.
>> GitLens gives a large overview & project oversight for Source Control:
- Commits > Commit Details > File History > Branches / Remotes / Stashes > Worktrees > Tags
- Search & Compare (Compare SHA/Message/Author/etc.)
- Visualization of commits overtime (merging GitGraph & Git History)
- Blame Information - "Who made what & where @ what time" A.K.A. File Annotation
- View > Appearance > Panel > GitLens has its own spot. ("Mildly gimmicky")
